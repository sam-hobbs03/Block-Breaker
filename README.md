# Block-Breaker
This is a game I made in Y13 as part of my coursework. I have made a few modifications to it and decided to release it as a full program.
The main purpose of this game is to be a modern interpretation of Atari Breakout. I have played hrough/analyzed several different versions and adaptations of the game to be
able to produce this, and I am very proud of it. 
This version of the game is far from perfect, so expect some bugs or imperfections here and there. I tried my best, but sometimes there are bugs which are just hard to fix.
I hope you all enjoy!
